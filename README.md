# LLMs
This repository contains a Python script and Jupyter notebook for retrieving details about language models using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn prettytable
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
- If you are using a venv then activate it, then run this is your terminal
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
- If using Jupyter Notebook then the repo contains the notebook named `LLM.pynb` open it and run it.

5. **Enter Model Name:**
   - Input the model name when prompted to see details.

## Dataset

The script uses a dataset (`llm.csv`) for model details. You can customize the dataset or replace it with your own.

## Script Details

- The `main.py` file contains the Python script.
- It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find and display details of the most similar language model based on user input.

## Example

```bash
Enter Model Name to see the details: [Enter Model Name]
```

*This dataset is still under construction, it takes time to search all the details. The ChatGPT dont provide the information for all the models so i have to do it myself. If you are intrested in this journey then come join me!*
